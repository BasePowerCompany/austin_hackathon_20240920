### Challenge: Power outage prediction

### Objective:
Determine the probability of power outages across the Texas power grid

### Context:
Electricity is a key part of modern life and the aging infrastructure that it’s built upon is struggling to keep up with growing demand. Base is deploying a fleet of energy storage systems across Texas to improve reliability for the power grid.
**Why this was chosen**: By understanding the likelihood of power outages, we can more effectively respond and even preempt power outages across the power grid.

### Key reasons to pick this challenge:
* Energy security: Energy is the bedrock of modern society. From steel manufacturing to datacenter operations, modern society depends on electricity. Now more than ever, we need to modernize the “world’s largest machine” to ensure it can last another 100 years.
* Will help keep people’s lights on: Base has a network of battery storage systems across Texas which actively serve to backup home power. If you find a novel strategy, it could go live and start keeping the lights on for families across Texas this winter. 

### Who Would Benefit from the Solution:
Families in Texas: Help keep the lights on for families across the state.
The power grid: With better outage prediction, we can take preventative actions like trimming foliage and moving power lines underground. 
National Security: Energy security is a key component in keeping our nation safe. Help us make improvements where we need it to improve the grid’s resiliency
